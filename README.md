# Statistication
This is a console app created for doing statistics for Modern Physics Lab at RIT using Python.

### Structure of data files
Any file can be a data file, but as of right now they can only be Tab-Separated files.
An example of a file looks like:
```
#NAME	Length of String	5 Periods Time Interval
#VAR	L	5T
#UNIT	m	s
50	6.9
40	5.89
30	5.3
20	4.49
10	3.13
```
Note that every gap between each separate object is a tab so that the program can recognise each column separately.
